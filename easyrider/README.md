# Dependencies

The main dependency you need is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can use either LTS or current version. Both should work.

In order to check that the installation was properly done, open a terminal and type

```
npm -v
```

The version number of npm (Node Package Manager) should be displayed with no errors.

# Installation

Once Node is installed, you need to install the project dependencies.

Open a terminal and go to the frontend project folder (`easyrider`). Inside this folder there should be a file called `package.json`. Then type

```
npm install
```

# Running the application

After installing the dependencies you can run the application by typing

```
npm start
```

After several seconds, a new browser tab should automatically open and display the application. If not, you can go directly to http://localhost:3000
